Simple Feed List is a WordPress plugin that displays a list of entries from a valid RSS feed.

== Description ==

This is a very useful way to display RSS feed data in a list format - news updates, site updates, software updates, etc. All you need is the URL of the RSS feed.

To display a feed on your WordPress site you will need to either insert a call to a PHP function, where appropriate, into your theme or use a shortcode. Use the latter for displaying a list in a post/page and the former for displaying a list in the sidebar or elsewhere on the site.

**PHP Function**

`<?php simple_feed_list('listurl','paras'); ?>`

Where..

*listurl* : This is the URL of your RSS feed

*paras* : This is an optional list of parameters, each seperated by an ampersand (&)

The `paras` are as follows...

*limit* : The number of items to display from 1 to 20 (default is 5)

*desc* : This indicates whether you wish to display the description on the line below. This should be "Yes" or "No" or a numeric length. If omitted, it will assume to be "No". If a number is specified this will be used as the maximum length of the description.

*title* : This indicates the length that you wish to restrict the feed title to (in characters). By default, this will be unlimited.

*more* : By default, "More..." will be displayed at the bottom of the list with a link to the list URL. If you specify "No" then this will be omitted.
 
*nofollow* : If set as "Yes", this adds a `REL="NOFOLLOW"` tag to the links.

*target* : Specify the target of any links (default is _BLANK)

The plugin will then display a list of entries from the RSS as an HTML list (i.e. with `<li>` and `</li>` around each entry).

An example would be...

`<?php simple_feed_list('http://images.apple.com/trailers/home/rss/newtrailers.rss','limit=5'); ?>`

This would display a list of the latest 5 movie trailers from the Apple site. Descriptions will not be shown.

`<?php simple_feed_list('http://images.apple.com/trailers/home/rss/newtrailers.rss','limit=5&desc=200'); ?>`

This would display a list of the latest 5 movie trailers from the Apple site. Descriptions will be shown, up to a maximum length of 200 characters.

The following is an example of how it could be used, with a `function_exists` check so that it doesn't cause problems if the plugin is not active...

`<?php if (function_exists('simple_feed_list')) : ?>`
`<h2>Latest Apple Movie Trailers</h2>`
`<ul><?php simple_feed_list('http://images.apple.com/trailers/home/rss/newtrailers.rss','limit=5'); ?></ul>`
`<?php endif; ?>`

If you specify a `limit` of just 1, then the `<li>` tags will not be used, allowing you to embed the result in a sentence. For example, you could use a feed of quotes and use this to just display the latest quote.

**Shortcode**

A shortcode of `[feedlist]` can be used with any of the following parameters (only the first is required) - `listurl`, `limit`, `desc` , `more`, `target` and `nofollow`. The formats of these parameters are the same as those above.

Using the Apple trailers example from above, you would write...

`[feedlist listurl="http://images.apple.com/trailers/home/rss/newtrailers.rss" limit=5]`

The results are presented as an unordered list - unlike the PHP function, this includes the `<ul>` and `</ul>` tags surrounding it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `simple-feed-list` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. There is no options screen - configuration is done in your code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you have any example RSS feeds to use? =

Yes.

== Changelog ==  
  
= 1.0 =  
* Initial release

= 1.1 =  
* Added ability to specify a maximum length for the description

= 1.2 =
* Check for CDATA within the title or description and strip out the tags if found. This resolves an issue where some feeds weren't displaying (especially those provided by FeedBurner)
* Use alternative method to file_get_contents to read content of feed - this means that allow_url_fopen does not need to be switched on in users PHP configuration. This has also improved performance of the plugin - it is now approx. 50% quicker

= 1.3 =
* Ok, that last change didn't work as well as I expected - the replacement file routine isn't compatible with PHP 4. I have therefore converted this to ANOTHER version, but one that is at least compatible with PHP 4.

= 1.4 =
* CDATA now stripped from URL address

= 2.0 =
* Complete re-write using WordPress' own RSS parsing and caching
* Added functionality to read multiple parameters seperated by an ampersand
* Added new `nofollow`, `target`, `cache` and `more` parameters

= 2.1 =
* Improved the message output when a feed can't be displayed
* Added shortcode option

= 2.2 =
* Added new parameter to restrict length of feed title

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.0 =
* More efficient feed retrieval, including caching

= 2.1 =
* Ability to use a shortcode to display a feed list

= 2.2 =
* New parameter to restrict length of feed title
